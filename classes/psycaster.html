        <h1>Psycaster - UNFINIHSED</h1>
        <br>
        <h3><i> INSERT PSYCASTER BESTOWING CEREMONY THINGY </i></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Surrounded by tribals, a highmate focuses their neural energy and unleashes a wave of psychic terror, driving their enemies insane.  In the middle of a heated argument among nations, a sanguophage utters a word of trust, turning the tides to their favor. In a last ditch effort to save their skins, a psycaster teleports himself and all his nearby allies miles away, just before their colony is destroyed. </p>
        <p>Psycasters have access to an organic connection to a larger psychic field. This allows a psycaster to psychically induce a distant archotech superintelligence to influence reality in ways that seem impossible. Higher levels of psylink permit the use of more powers. As a physical phenomenon in the brain, psylink is poorly-understood by scientists, not least because it seems to actively conceal itself if studied too closely. One thing most agree on is that it somehow connects people to archotechs and harnesses their power, possibly through some sort of negotiation or sympathy mechanism.</p>

        <h2>Powerful Psylinks</h2>
        <p>The ability to induce archotechs comes from psylink level, which is just a more or less arbitrary categorization of the power and size of effect a certain psychic ability - or psycast-, will have. Regardless of psylink level, a person can only use specific powers that they have learned. Psylink comes from a variety of sources. Single-use psylink neuroformer devices can create a psylink. Tribal peoples also know how to develop it through ritual linking with the legendary anima tree. Neuroformer devices are archotech originated, and are very rare. Almost all neuroformer devices come, in some way, from the Imperial Empire. In order to use their psylinks, psycasters must spend long periods of time meditating to store "psyfocus": a mental resource that psycasters channel into their abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Bicultural Origns</h2>
        <p>Most Psycasters generally fall into one of two categories: Imperial and Tribal. Psycasting can either be seen as harnessing the power of the archotechs, or communing with the gods to curry favor. Typically, a psycaster's power is unfulfiled in any other culture. Medival cultures generally frown upon what they consider as "dark magic", and Industrials don't believe in psychic phenomena, to a point. Psycasters are far rarer in these scenarios. However, Tribals see psycasters as conduits for divine power, and Imperials feel that it is only natural for a ruler to have some kind of mystical ability. Imperials, being of a highly advanced scientific culture, also are the only societies that attempt to fully understand psychic phenomena.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Creating a Psycaster</h2>
        <p>The most important thing to consider when creating a psycaster is your connection to the psychic plane. It is recommended to have at least one. Were you born with some kind of psychic sensitivity? Is it a result of your genetics? Perhaps from an early age, you were trained for the role, gifted neural implants to stimulate a connection. Secondly, what lead you to an adventuring life? It's not uncommon for psycasters to flee their homeworlds, or to wander the wastes of a Rimworld. Perhaps you felt unfulfiled in your mundane life, or felt too pressured by your guardians. Maybe you seek to gain deeper connection to the archotechs with whom you communicate. Perhaps you seek to sever that connection. You may even feel destined to some greater purpose, lead by the archotechs that you feel created you.</p>
        <br>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>Psycasting</h1>
        <p>Your connection to a larger psychic field allows you to psychically induce a distant archotech superintelligence to influence reality in ways that seem impossible. The mechanics of how this works are listed in this page. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Psycasts</h3>
        <p>You can cast as many psycasts as you wish, so long as you have psyfocus to fuel them. Psycasts generally do not have spell save DCs. If they do, use the following formula: <b>Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</b>. Most psycasts are tested directly against the psychic sensitivity of your intended target, which is 100% for most humans. If their psychic sensitivity is higher, your psycasts will have greater effect. If their psychic sensitivity is lower, however, it will have lesser effect.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Psyfocus and Neural Heat</h3>
        <p>Psyfocus is a special type of mental structuring which is necessary to use psychic powers. Psyfocus dissipates over time, and must be built by regular meditation. Losing all psyfocus makes someone unable to use psychics, but has no other consequences. Higher levels of psyfocus permit higher-level powers. Psyfocus on its own degrades of a rate of 5% (out of 100%) each day. Each psycast requires a certain amount of psyfocus to cast, and creates a certain amount of Neural Heat. Despite being called "heat", neural heat is not a measure of temperature. It refers to a type of chaotic psychic energy in the mind which is built up when using psychic powers and dissipates over the course of a few seconds or minutes. If neural heat is pushed past normal limits, it may cause temporary psychic breakdown and unconsciousness due to psychic shock. Being in pain also causes your neural heat to dissapate quicker. The exact mechanics of neural heat loss and neural heat limit is known to your DM, but can be referred to with these equations: <b>Neural Heat Limit = (2 + Psylink level) * 10 * Psychic Sensitivity</b>. <b>Neural Heat Recovery Rate Per Minute = ((0.54 + Gear Offsets)*(0.875 + 0.125*Psylink level)) * (1+3*(Max HP/Current HP))</b>. Every time you cast a psycast that pushes you over your neural heat limit, make a Constituion saving throw with a DC equal to half the amount you exceeded your limit by. If you fail, you incur some sort of temporary psychic breakdown. The nature of this breakdown is up to your DM's discretion.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Meditation</h3>
        <p>With a few exceptions, psyfocus can only be gained through meditation. Psycasters gain a base rate of +50% psyfocus per full day, or +2% per hour of pure meditation. Meditation foci further improve these rates by their listed strength. For example, a nature shrine nearby to a Tribal pyscaster's meditation point increases psyfocus gain by +22%/day, for a total of 72% psyfocus per day, or +3% per hour. This can be increased to a total of +96% per day, or +4% per hour</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Psycasts Known of 1st Level or Higher</h3>
        <p>You know two 1st level psycasts of your choice from the psycasts list. The Psycasts Known column of the Psycaster table shows when you learn nmore psycasts of your choice. Each of these must be within your Psylevel, detailed by the Psylevel column of the Psycaster table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you may choose one of the psycasts you know and replace it with another psycast from among the psycasts you have access to.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Psychic Origin</h2>
        <p>Choose a psychic origin, which determines your starting culture: Tribal or Imperial, described at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and 5th level.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Psychich Connection</h3>
        <p>In addition to your psychic origin, choose a way you connect to the psychic plane. Your choice can be anything, and mostly affect only your past in this world. The recommended choices are being Psycically Sensitive from birth, having the Psy Sensitive gene, or, being implanted with a Psycic Sensitizer device. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Focused Meditation</h2>
        <p>At 3nd level and 6th level, your time spent meditating becomes more focused and intense. Your psyfocus gain rate increases by 24% a day.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Deeper Meditation</h2>
        <p>At 4th and 7th level, your max psyfocus level increases by 25%. </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Psycaster Origins</h1>
        <p>You came from somewhere before you became a fully capable psycaster. Here, the two origins are Tribal and Imperial</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Tribal Connection</h2>
        <p>You grew up among a small band of low technology tribals, who worked the land for their survival. When your psycasting abilties emerged, your deep connection to the land became apparent. You gain psylink levels through your connection to your tribe's Anima tree, a rare tree with warm, skin-smooth bark and long iridescent leaves. Infused with bioluminescent micro-organisms, anima trees develop a unique form of psychic symbiosis with surrounding lifeforms, allowing them to grow in a wide variety of biomes. Your tribe believed that anima trees are not simply trees, but are rather the physical extremities of a single world spirit. At 5th level, you can communicate with nature on a basic level. You can cast <i>Speak with Plants</i> and <i>Speak with Animals</i> once per day without material components. In addition, your neural heat decreases twice as fast.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Nature Connected</h3>
        <p>At 1st level, your connection to nature increases your connection to the Archotechs. While outdoors, you lose psyfocus slower, at a rate of 3% a day instead of 5%. At the end of the day, if you were mostly outdoors, choose 3%. If you were mostly indoors, choose 5% </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Based on Honor</h2>
        <p> The catch-all for psycasters with no connection to nature, Imperial psycasters are those who work in tandem with the Empire in exchange for psylink neuroformers. Psycasters will curry favor with the Empire, earning neuroformers and royal titles. Titles are marks of rank in the Royalty Hierachy. The first title is Freeholder (1st level), and goes through to Novice (3rd level), Acolyte (5th level), Knight/Dame (8th level), Praetor (11th level), Baron/baroness (15th level), Archon (18th level). While you may not work or live directly with Royals, you rely on them for increasing your psychic abilities. If you displease them in some way, you will lose your main way of increasing your talents. When you gain the Acolyte title at 5th level, you also gain access to Royal Permits: special requests immediately fulfilled by the empire. These are detailed in the Permits section </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Royal Blood</h3>
        <p>At 1st level, your connection to luxury and wealth causes you to lose psyfocus slower. While indoors, you lose psyfocus slower, at a rate of 3% a day instead of 5%. At the end of the day, if you were mostly indoors, choose 3%. If you were mostly outdoors, choose 5%</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Permits</h3>
        <p>Due to the rapport you have established with the empire, they have given you access to some of their emergency systems. One permit is awarded for every title from Acolyte onwards, for a maximum of five permits for Archons. Higher titles will give access to stronger permits. These can include item drops, immediate support, or even direct bombardments. Permits have a cooldown; if used during it, there will be diplomatic consequences, and you risk losing rapport with the empire. Permits are listed at the end of this page, after psycasts.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Armor, Gear and Implants</h1>
        <p>Psycasters wear a special psychic focusing material, known as Eltex. Eltex enhances psychic sensitivity and helps to dissipate neural heat. There are many different Eltex items, each with their own properties. High quality Eltex gear increases psychic sensitivity and neural heat limit. In addition, there are a few neural implants which effect psychic sensitivity.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Armor and Gear</h2>
        <p>Most psycasting gear is designed to increase psychic sensitivity as much as possible, some protective armor does exist, though it does not increase psychic sensitivity as much. In addition, there exists Prestige versions of the Spacer armors (Recon, Marine and Cataphract). Each requires gold in its creation, and takes much longer to complete.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Eltex Helmet</h3>
        <p>A lightweight helmet designed for psychic focusing. While it provides little physical protection, its special materials enhance the wearer's psychic sensitivity and dissipate neural heat.</p>

        <p>+5 psychic sensitivity, +4 neural heat limit, +0.033/m base neural heat recovery rate.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Implants</h2>
        <p>There is only one implant that boosts psychic sensitivity, and can be implanted into a being only once.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Psychic Sensitizer</h3>
        <p>This brain implant stimulates growth in the regions of the brain related to psychic interaction, thus increasing psychic sensitivity.</p>
        <p>+25 psychic sensitivity, +20 neural heat limit.</p>
