        <h3><i>Before you lies the remains of a massive, ancient exostrider war mechanoid. In its guts, it looks like there is a still-functional transponder. If you could extract the transponder, you could decrypt it to gather valuable information.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Dozens of gleaming metal automatons stream forth towards the enemy, at the command of their unasuming creator.</p> 
        <p>Surrounded by bloody corpses, a single centipede continues to defend its creator, long after its commander can no longer stand. Running at the front of his army, a mechanitor leads a wave of blades and knives towards an unsuspecting band of tribals.</p>
        <p>Mechanitors are those who are able to create and control their very own mechanoids. The technology required to create mechanitors has been lost to this rimworld, but the creation and control of mechanoids is still in force, if highly uncommon. Most mechanitors are reclusive strangers that don't trust anything but themselves and the work of their own hands. However, some colonies integrate mechanitors into their ranks and help build the support structure needed for a colony wide system of mechanoid creation and control. Even rarer are those who wander across the land with their mechanoids, since the infrastructure needed for stronger mechanoids is hard to miniaturize. However, all sorts of unique items can be found or created to increase the capacities of a mechanitor. </p>

        <h2>Unwavering Machines</h2>
        <p>The ability to create and use mechanoids is considered to be the epitome of automation and control. If you require your needs to be waited on by unthinking and unwavering servants that obey your every whim, or love the idea of taking care of machines that take care of you, then becoming a mechanitor is for you. Using a mechlink - a rare neural implant - mechanitors are able to psychically connect with their mechs in order to command them. Their mechs are suited for any number of tasks, including war, production, medical care, and more. Mechanitors are smiths by trade, but tinkerers by passion. While mechanoid gestators take the care of the creation of most mechanoids, all take damage and wear over time. Mechanitors must have the know-how and ability to repair and maintain these machines, or else they must routinely undergo the expensive process of gestating new mechanoids. Second in a mechanitor's toolset is their intellect. They must have both the hands on knowledge needed to repair mechanoids, but also the knowledge of the mechanical and electrical process that go into making mechanoids work.</p>
        <p>Mechanitors depend on four things: power, bandwith, mech gestation, and waste management, since all mechanoids require power, the ability for a mechanitor to support them, and the ability for fallen mechanoids to be ressurrected. In addition, mechanoids also create a certain amount of toxic waste, which is discharged upon being recharged. Traveling mechanitors face many troubles, as maintaining mechanoids requies infrastructure best built in a colony, but not waste managment. Understandably, most traveling mechanitors make sure they always have a home to return to if needed. However, mechanitors must make sure they have some source of alternative power before they travel long distances, for fear of their mechanoids losing power before they return. Bandwith is a measure of how many mechanoids a mechanitor can mentally link to at once. It can be increased through either building antenna farms to boost their signal power, or by developing high tech armor and additional neural implants. Due to the necessity of sometimes extensive body modification to increase their effeciency, mechanitors often also become transhumanists: those who seek to replace as much of their body as possible with bionics and implants.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Technological Prowess</h2>
        <p>Mechanitors tend to be loners who isolate themselves from society at large, either as eccentric recluses or isolationist loners. Those who don't tend to be adventurers hunting rare technology, or ruthless guns for hire. Either way, they depend on technology for their support. When threats come to them and their machines, they act like a disturbed hornet's nest, eliminating any threat. When they do travel, either to elimanate a threat or to uncover rare technology and gear, they make for great traveling companions, since their tireless, sleepless soldiers can keep watch effortlessly, and can provide many creature comforts while in the wilds of the rim. Mechanitors on the move tend to take much of their home with them, constantly surrounded by their wealth of technological and the devices needed to support them.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Creating a Mechanitor</h2>
        <p>The most important thing to consider when creating an adventuring mechanitor is how you gaind your mechlink. Were you born with it, but you fled from the core-worlds to seek solitude? Are you a tribal that stumbled upon an ancient mechlink in a destroyed ruin? And secondly, why are you adventuring? Are you now adventuring to regain the technological prowess you once had? Is it to protect your home? Fight for your religion? Collect an anciet relic, to analyze later in your private laboratory? Also consider how you feel about technology, and your mechs. Are they means to an end, a way to get what you want? Are they a replacement for friends? A way to never lose a friend again? Do you consider yourself to be the next stage of human evolution? </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Quick Build</h3>

            <li>One "basic mechtech" mechanoid, from the list below</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Mechanitor Type</h2>
        <p>Choose your particular kind of leadership. Either a front-line fighter with bonuses to your combat skills, or a stalwart planner who commands from the shadows. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level, and again at 5th level.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Mech Tech Research</h2>
        <p>At 5th level and 10th level, your time spent researching and studying mechanoid technology allows you to increase your mechtech by 1 level.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Fast Hands</h2>
        <p>At 2nd and 7th level, you gain a 33.3% crafing increase, and the minimum quality of your crafts increases by 1. This includes anything related to item making or crafting. </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Mechlord General</h1>
        <p>Mechlords are those who love to fight in and alongside their mechanoids, in the heat of battle. They tend to focus on improving their fighting skills more so than directly improving their relationship with their mechs.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Survival Adaptation</h2>
        <p>Your desire to be the prime figher you can be leads you to practice with a front-line figther's weapon. At 1st level, choose a melee weapon of your choice. Gain profeciency with it. (Ask your DM about crafting it yourself). At 5th level, do this again for another melee weapon, and gain proficiency in the next highest armor class avaliable to you.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Mechanist Commander</h1>
        <p>Mech Commanders typically prefer to let their mechanoids do their work for them, especially when it comes to combat. Whether or not they know how to defend themselves, they believe their mechs are their front line fighters. As such, they tend to focus on boosting the output of their mechanoids.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Inspiring Leadership</h2>
        <p>At 1st level, your devotion to your mechs has brough you a small breakthrough. You gain an extra 3 bandwith to draw from. At 5th level, you gain 3 more bandwith, and discover a breakthrough tech that allows you to temporarily boost a the capabilities of a mechanoid for up to 1 hour each day. If it is a production mechanoid, it works twice as fast, if it is a combat mechanoid, it gains +1d4 to its attack rolls and damage rolls, and gains +2 AC.  </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Mechanoids</h1>
        <p>The key feature of Mechanitors is ability to create and control mechanoids, but some take much research and technology to craft. All mechanoids are gestated in special pods, where they are assembled by the atom. Mechanoids fall into one of two categories: those meant for combat and those meant for production. Both types are listed here, even if you might be primarily using combat mechs. All mechanoids can be constantly run for 10 days before needing to be recharged Much like spell slots, mechanoids each require a certain level of researched technology. Heavier mechanoids also require more bandwith. As a starting mechanitor, you can choose one mech from the "basic mechtech" tier. This is considered to be your inaugural mechanoid, or the very first one you have ever created.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p>Guns, blades, and flamethrowers.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Militor</h3>
        <p>A small combat mechanoid armed with a low-powered mini-shotgun. Roughly four feet tall, militors lack the power, range, and toughness of more senior combat mechs. However, it is cheap to gestate and maintain, and so is often used as a rear guard or swarm attacker. In war, mech armies are known to send militors into urban ruins to hunt down survivors after breaking the human defenses. For this reason, they are considered by some to be the most cruel of all mechanoid patterns.</p>
        <p><b>Class:</b> Light</p>

        <p>The two most important limitations for an aspiring mechanitor to understand are bandwith and mechtech. Bandwith is the limit of how many mechanoids you can connect to at one time, while your level of mechtech determines the complexity of mechanoid that you can create.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Increasing Bandwith</h2>
        <p>Bandwith is typically increased through construction of large array farms, but it also naturally increases as a mechanitor grows their powers. As you level up, your connection will increase gradually with your mechs, but it can also be increased through use of special gear and items, later explained on this page. Heavier mechanoids take up more bandwith, so make sure you have enough before divesting into large mechanoids</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Increasing Your Mechtech Level</h2>
        <p>While increasing your mechtech level is rather straightforwad, it is a daunting task. To increase your mechtech level, you must defeat large and feasome mechanoids and their enterage. Mechanoids like the Diabolus and War Queen all contain special relay chips that allow them to synchronize with their mechhive as a whole. They also contain wealths of info about the particular mechanoids they typically associate with, so any mechanitor can anaylze the data to also understand that level of mechanoid. Diaboli contain signal chips, which allow access to standard mechtech, War Queens contain powerfocus chips, which allow access to high mechtech, and Apocritons contain nanostructuring chips, which allow access to ultra mechtech.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Armor, Gear and Implants</h1>
        <p>Like any culture, Mechanitors have armor and items specifically tailored for their needs. Mechanitor armor typically increases bandwith limit, while their implants generally serve special purposes, like repairing mechanoids faster or gestating them quicker.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Armor and Gear</h2>
        <p>While all mechanitor creations are built to serve their hive, some worn items are non protecting.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Airwire Headset</h3>
        <p>A simple head-mounted comms computer that slightly enhances a mechanitor's control bandwidth. This allows them to control more mechs.</p>
        <p>+3 Bandwith, 0 AC bonus. Requires at least standard mechtech and 4 <a href="https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Component" target="_blank">components</a></p>
