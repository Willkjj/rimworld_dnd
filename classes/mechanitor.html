        <h1>Mechanitors</h1>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Before you lies the remains of a massive, ancient exostrider war mechanoid. In its guts, it looks like there is a still-functional transponder. If you could extract the transponder, you could decrypt it to gather valuable information.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Dozens of gleaming metal automatons stream forth towards the enemy, at the command of their unasuming creator.</p> 
        <p>Surrounded by bloody corpses, a single centipede continues to defend its creator, long after its commander can no longer stand. Running at the front of his army, a mechanitor leads a wave of blades and knives towards an unsuspecting band of tribals.</p>
        <p>Mechanitors are those who are able to create and control their very own mechanoids. The technology required to create mechanitors has been lost to this rimworld, but the creation and control of mechanoids is still in force, if highly uncommon. Most mechanitors are reclusive strangers that don't trust anything but themselves and the work of their own hands. However, some colonies integrate mechanitors into their ranks and help build the support structure needed for a colony wide system of mechanoid creation and control. Even rarer are those who wander across the land with their mechanoids, since the infrastructure needed for stronger mechanoids is hard to miniaturize. However, all sorts of unique items can be found or created to increase the capacities of a mechanitor. </p>
        <!-- Three things a traveling mechanitor needs: 
         1. Portable power (doesn't exist in base game)
         2. Portable bandwith (gear and items)
         3. Portable gestation pods (doesn't exist in base game) -->
        <br>
        <h2>Unwavering Machines</h2>
        <p>The ability to create and use mechanoids is considered to be the epitome of automation and control. If you require your needs to be waited on by unthinking and unwavering servants that obey your every whim, or love the idea of taking care of machines that take care of you, then becoming a mechanitor is for you. Using a mechlink - a rare neural implant - mechanitors are able to psychically connect with their mechs in order to command them. Their mechs are suited for any number of tasks, including war, production, medical care, and more. Mechanitors are smiths by trade, but tinkerers by passion. While mechanoid gestators take the care of the creation of most mechanoids, all take damage and wear over time. Mechanitors must have the know-how and ability to repair and maintain these machines, or else they must routinely undergo the expensive process of gestating new mechanoids. Second in a mechanitor's toolset is their intellect. They must have both the hands on knowledge needed to repair mechanoids, but also the knowledge of the mechanical and electrical process that go into making mechanoids work.</p>
        <p>Mechanitors depend on four things: power, bandwith, mech gestation, and waste management, since all mechanoids require power, the ability for a mechanitor to support them, and the ability for fallen mechanoids to be ressurrected. In addition, mechanoids also create a certain amount of toxic waste, which is discharged upon being recharged. Traveling mechanitors face many troubles, as maintaining mechanoids requies infrastructure best built in a colony, but not waste managment. Understandably, most traveling mechanitors make sure they always have a home to return to if needed. However, mechanitors must make sure they have some source of alternative power before they travel long distances, for fear of their mechanoids losing power before they return. Bandwith is a measure of how many mechanoids a mechanitor can mentally link to at once. It can be increased through either building antenna farms to boost their signal power, or by developing high tech armor and additional neural implants. Due to the necessity of sometimes extensive body modification to increase their effeciency, mechanitors often also become transhumanists: those who seek to replace as much of their body as possible with bionics and implants.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Technological Prowess</h2>
        <p>Mechanitors tend to be loners who isolate themselves from society at large, either as eccentric recluses or isolationist loners. Those who don't tend to be adventurers hunting rare technology, or ruthless guns for hire. Either way, they depend on technology for their support. When threats come to them and their machines, they act like a disturbed hornet's nest, eliminating any threat. When they do travel, either to elimanate a threat or to uncover rare technology and gear, they make for great traveling companions, since their tireless, sleepless soldiers can keep watch effortlessly, and can provide many creature comforts while in the wilds of the rim. Mechanitors on the move tend to take much of their home with them, constantly surrounded by their wealth of technological and the devices needed to support them.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Creating a Mechanitor</h2>
        <p>The most important thing to consider when creating an adventuring mechanitor is how you gaind your mechlink. Were you born with it, but you fled from the core-worlds to seek solitude? Are you a tribal that stumbled upon an ancient mechlink in a destroyed ruin? And secondly, why are you adventuring? Are you now adventuring to regain the technological prowess you once had? Is it to protect your home? Fight for your religion? Collect an anciet relic, to analyze later in your private laboratory? Also consider how you feel about technology, and your mechs. Are they means to an end, a way to get what you want? Are they a replacement for friends? A way to never lose a friend again? Do you consider yourself to be the next stage of human evolution? </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Quick Build</h3>
        <p>You can make a mechanitor quickly by following these suggestions. First, intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose a militor to be your mechanoid</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Class Features</h1>
        <p>As a mechanitor, you gain the following class features</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Hit Points</h3>
        <p><b>Hit Dice:</b>1d6 per Mechanitor level</p>
        <p><b>Hit Points at 1st Level:</b> 6 + your Constitution modifier</p>
        <p><b>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</b> 1d6 (or4) + your Constitution modifier per socerer level after 1st level</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Proficiencies</h3>
        <p><b>Armor:</b> light, mechcommander</p>
        <p><b>Weapons:</b> Daggers, quarterstaffs, slings, maces</p>
        <p><b>Tools:</b> One tool of your choice from crafting/artesian toolkits</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Saving Throws:</b> Intelligence, Wisdom</p>
        <p><b>Skills:</b> Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, History, Medicine, Investigation, Perception</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>(a)</i>A masterwork autopistol or <i>(b)</i> any simple weapon with cost less that 500 silver (quality will be Excellent)</li>
            <li><i>(a)</i>An airwire headset or <i>(b)</i> additional starting mechanoid</li>
            <li><i>(a)</i>Explorer's pack or <i>(b)</i> scholar's pack</li>
            <li>One "basic mechtech" mechanoid, from the list below</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1>Mechanoids</h1>
        <p>The key feature of Mechanitors is ability to create and control mechanoids, but some take much research and technology to craft. Mechanoids fall into one of two categories: those meant for combat and those meant for production. Both types are listed here, even if you might be primarily using combat mechs. Much like spell slots, mechanoids each require a certain level of researched technology. Heavier mechanoids also require more bandwith. As a starting mechanitor, you can choose one mech from the "basic mechtech" tier. This is considered to be your inaugural mechanoid, or the very first one you have ever created.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Combat</h2>
        <p>Guns, blades, and flamethrowers.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Militor</h3>
        <p>A small combat mechanoid armed with a low-powered mini-shotgun. Roughly four feet tall, militors lack the power, range, and toughness of more senior combat mechs. However, it is cheap to gestate and maintain, and so is often used as a rear guard or swarm attacker. In war, mech armies are known to send militors into urban ruins to hunt down survivors after breaking the human defenses. For this reason, they are considered by some to be the most cruel of all mechanoid patterns.</p>
        <p><b>Class:</b> Light</p>
        <p><b>Damage Die:</b> 1d8 piercing</p>
        <p><b>Bandwith: </b> 1</p>
        <p><b>Research Level:</b> Basic Mechtech</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Pikeman</h3>
        <p>A clunky multi-legged combat mechanoid specialized as a long-range weapons platform. While effective at distance, it is weak in close-range fights and in melee combat. Veterans of mechanoid wars know that often, the safest place to be around a pikeman is touching it.</p>
        <p><b>Class:</b> Medium</p>
        <p><b>Damage Die:</b> 1d8+3 piercing</p>
        <p><b>Bandwith: </b> 2</p>
        <p><b>Research Level:</b> Standard Mechtech</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Scorcher</h3>
        <p>A close-approach war mechanoid that specializes in incendiary attacks. Its flame burst attack has little reach, but once it closes on a group of defenders it can ignite and disrupt them with blasts of searing flame.</p>
        <p><b>Class:</b> Medium</p>
        <p><b>Damage Die:</b> 1d6 fire (starts fires)</p>
        <p><b>Bandwith: </b> 1</p>
        <p><b>Research Level:</b> Standard Mechtech</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Scyther</h3>
        <p>Fast, spindly, human-sized combat mechanoids specializing in rapid approach and close-range combat. Their bodies are covered in points and blades, but they mostly use their two arm blades to lop off limbs or gut their victims alive.</p>
        <p><b>Class:</b> Medium</p>
        <p><b>Damage Dice:</b> 2d6 +2 slashing</p>
        <p><b>Bandwith: </b> 2</p>
        <p><b>Research Level:</b> Standard Mechtech</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Lancer</h3>
        <p>Fast human-sized combat mechanoids built for medium and long-range combat. Their bodies are light, making them vulnerable targets at close range - especially in melee combat -, but they are deadly in their element.</p>
        <p><b>Class:</b> Medium</p>
        <p><b>Damage Dice:</b> 2d6 +2 piercing</p>
        <p><b>Bandwith: </b> 3</p>
        <p><b>Research Level:</b> High Mechtech</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Non-combat</h2>
        <p>Mechanoids for production, farming, and home-making activities.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Agrihand</h3>
        <p>A small mechanoid designed to sow and harvest crops. While it is better suited to labor than combat, it can fight with built-in cutting blades if necessary.</p>
