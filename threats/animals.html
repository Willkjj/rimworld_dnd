        <h3><i>A pack of scaria-infested animals have arrived, hunting for human flesh....</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Most animals on the Rim are inherently peaceful, even when attacked. A few may attack when provoked, especially repeatedly, but none pose more of a threat than a pack of manhunters. Infected by a nigh-incurable disease known as scaria, these animals band together and flock through the lands. No one is exactly sure how this phenomenon occurs, but when it does, dozens or even hundreds of man-hunting animals swarm the region, running down any human they can find. As far as we know, no animal is immune to this disease. Reports have been gathered of manhunting rhinoceroses and elephants, to dogs or squirrels. Even great Thrumbos can be affected! Since they can quickly swarm and overwhelm even a relatively large number of humans, the best thing to do when attacked by a pack is to retreat to safer ground. Even bunching behind a doorway or corridor can mean the difference between becoming overwhelmed by numbers, and security.</p>
