        <h1>Mechanoids</h1>
        <br>
        <h3><i>Killer machines of unknown origin. Hidden in ancient structures, under mounds of dust, or at the bottom of the ocean, mechanoids can self-maintain for thousands of years. This group of mechs seems to be unified in purpose, but not well-coordinated in action. While local scholars believe they're autonomous weapons left over from an ancient war, tribal legends describe them as the demonic servants of a sleeping god.</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p>The most feared of all threats on the Rim. Once disturbed, a mechanoid nest will never sleep until all is razed. Even after the defending men and women are gone, mechanoids will gun down even children until no life remains. Whether the servants of an archotecch, or the lost puppets of a long dead mechanitor, mechanoid are programmed to kill. Ceaselessly. Endlessly. With hail of fire and rain of bullets, mechanoids swarm en mass and lay siege to colonies until nothing stands but bones and ruin. With a strong metal shell, and enough firepower to knock down nations, mechanoids are fearless machines that deserve to be feared. Weaknesses they have few, for their strong shell stops all but the most powerful of attacks. They are somewhat weak to blunt measures, and can be stunned for a time by EMP weapons.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Types of Mechanoids</h2>
        <p>Though there are almost hundreds of classifcations of mechanoids, the most common are listed here.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Scyther</h3>
        <p>Fast, spindly, human-sized combat mechanoids specializing in rapid approach and close-range combat. Their bodies are covered in points and blades, but they mostly use their two arm blades to lop off limbs or gut their victims alive.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Lancer</h3>
        <p>Fast human-sized combat mechanoids built for medium and long-range combat. Their bodies are light, making them vulnerable targets at close range - especially in melee combat.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Pikeman</h3>
        <p>A clunky multi-legged combat mechanoid specialized as a long-range weapons platform. While effective at distance, it is weak in close-range fights and in melee combat.</p>
        <p>Veterans of mechanoid wars know that often, the safest place to be around a pikeman is touching it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Centipede</h3>
        <p>Heavy combat mechanoids that glide on dozens of tiny legs. Their thick carapace and firepower makes them very effective against bunched-up static defenders. They are somewhat vulnerable to mobile hit-and-run tactics.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Diabolus</h3>
        <p>An ultra-heavy mechanoid with an ultra-powerful hellsphere cannon. Made for siegebreaking, its hellsphere cannon takes time to charge up a shot, but can melt concrete and vaporize bone. The diabolus dissipates the hellsphere cannon's waste power in a heat column mounted on its back, which can pulse to ignite flammable objects nearby.</p>
        <p>This mech's name comes from a thousand-year-old poem written by a Haspian monk who survived the erasure of his monastery. His religiously-tinged work describes a razor-bodied fiend pulsing with flesh-searing heat as it crushed scorched bodies under massive claws. The few who have faced a diabolus and survived tend to agree with this depiction.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>War Queen</h3>
        <p>An ultra-heavy mech with a built-in mech gestator. Fed with appropriate resources, the war queen can form small war urchin combat mechs within its massive carapace and deploy them into combat. Even more than other mechanoids, the war queen resembles a giant, living insect. All war mechs can be terrifying, but humans tend to find the war queen disturbing on a deeper level.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Apocriton</h3>
        <p>A mechanoid commander designed to coordinate and motivate other mechs during long extermination campaigns. Its most obvious power is its ability to resurrect recently-killed mechs by supercharging their self-repair processes. Less obviously, it is intelligent and psychically present, radiating hatred into the minds of anyone in a wide radius. It can also move quickly with its built-in jump launcher</p>
        <p>While all mechanoids have a dim psychically-present intelligence, only the apocriton and a few others truly feel hatred for their victims and understand the suffering they inflict.</p>
