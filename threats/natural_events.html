        <h1>Natural Events</h1>
        <br>
        <h3><i>The Gods, reaching down, smite those they call sinners, and we, the sinners, fear and tremble</i></h3>
        <br>
        <p>Turbulent and distructive, many natural threats plague the people of the rim. From uncontrollable events, such as solar flares and volcanic winters, to man-made events, such as toxic fallout and rogue weather systems. Most are simply unavoidable, but none are simply the end of life on the rim, or even the end of your life on the rim.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Flashstorm</h3>
        <p>Especially dangerous in the more arid parts of the rim, flashtorms are freak localized bursts of lightning, centered in a relatively small radius. Though short lived, they can cause wildfires that last for days. Most rimworlders try not to build their homes out of flammable objects, because of these.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Toxic Fallout</h3>
        <p>The result of a chemical fire, or some other large ecological disaster. Toxic fallouts blanket the region in thick, oily smoke that chokes out life from plants and animals. It is usually accompanied with toxic dust, which fills breath and lungs with toxic poison. Toxic fallout can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. The best way to survive these is to get under shelter and hope you've stockpiled enough food for the duration.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Solar Flares</h3>
        <p>A naturally occuring discharge of stellar material from the sun. It causes all electrical devices to cease functioning for its duration, which is typically just less than a day. Typically, this can be waited out.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Problem Causer</h3>
        <p>A category of threats caused by enemy camps. Occasionally, an enemy may stumble upon a piece of ultratechnology that can stop the sun from shining over a region, or send dissonant thoughts into the minds of each male, or cause dry thunderstorms to last perpetually. Whatever the effect, the solution is the same: find them and kill them.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Volcanic Winters</h3>
        <p>Caused by a distant supervolcano erupting, volcanic winters blanket entire regions with mounds of ash, sometimes thicker than snowfall. While this is not directly an issue itself, this can choke out the sun and leave crops to wither. Typically, this can be waited out, but make sure your food is stockpiled before this occurs.</p>
