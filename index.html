    <h1>Welcome to the Rim!</h1>
    <h3>What is Rimworld?</h3>
    <p>Rimworld is a space-cowboy themed game set roughly 3,000 years in the future. In it, you build a home and fight off raiders, deadly machines, and man-hunting animals in a desperate bid for survival. Hundreds of choices between starting technology, where to live and who to trust, and how to defend your wealth make for infinitely variable gameplay. It's my favorite game, and I have over 4,000 hours in it. Hence, this idea.</p>

    <p>Rimworld is not a very group focused game. You as the player control a colony, and there's not much room for much else. I decided, if I wanted others to enjoy seeing what I saw in the game, I should put a bunch of it into the only TTRPG format I know: D&D.</p>

    <p>The rest of this website will go through the lore of Rimworld needed to understand the conversion, as well as all the differences between base D&D and my amalgamation.</p>
