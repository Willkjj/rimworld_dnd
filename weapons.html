        <h3>100 guns for 50 people</h3>
        <br>
        <p>You'll need to defend yourself while on the rim. And while mass production is rare, scavenged items are not. Most denizens of the rim use any weapon they can find, if they can't make their own. So, stock up. Grab a shotgun to go with your greatbow. Carry an EMP launcher with your warhammer. There's a niche for nearly every weapon, so feel free to use any of them.</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of the rim, there is a people at every stage of development at any given time. Each of them are very capable at using their culture's weapons to defend themselves, or to attack their neighbors. In general, there are 5 distinct levels of technology: tribal, medieval, outlander (cowboy), industrial, spacer. Much of their technology is listed below.</p>
        <p>In addition, each item has a Quality property and Material property to it, with some exceptions. All ranged weapons have no material property to it, and thrown weapons like the frag grenade have no quality property either. Material type modifies the final damage. For example, a sword made out of a "bad" material like wood makes the damage 2 less, since wood deals less sharp damage. A club made of wood would have normal damage. A "good" material like steel works like normal, and an "great" material like the space-age plasteel would make a sword have +2 to damage. For armor, materials increases the AC. In addition, Quality affects both the attack roll and the final damage. For armor, quality increases the AC There are  7 quality modifiers, ranging from -2 to +4. Each weapon can have only one modifer, and will be determined by the DM upon crafting or discovery. The higher the modifier, the harder it is to find/create. The quality modifiers are as follows: Awful (-2), Poor (-1), Normal (+0), Good (+1), Excellent (+2), Masterwork (+3), Legendary (+4).</p>
        <h4>Note: If a weapon is listed here, it overwrites what is written in the Player's Handbook. Otherwise, feel free to use any weapon here or in the PHB as written.</h4>
        <br>
        <h2>Definitions:</h2>
        <p>Explosive: This weapon has an AOE attack, the range of which is defined after the property (ex. "Explosive:5ft" means the explosion radius is 5 ft in a sphere). All creatures within this range are targets of this attack. In addition, while you make an attack roll as usual, the target must make a dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the result of your attack roll. On a success, they take half damage.</p>
        <p>Single Shot: Though it has multiple damage die, it has one singular target and one attack roll.</p>
        <p>EMP: Its lightning damage is nondamaging, except creatues with electrical components will become stunned for 1-2 turns. 1 turn if the damgae is less than or equal to 10, 2 turns if higher.</p>
        <p>Blind Smoke: Reduces accuracy of any regular projectile, player or enemy, making the area lightly obscured and imposing disadvantage on attacks sent through the area. The smoke does not have to cover either the shooter or the target; any smoke in the way will cause the accuracy reduction. In addition, turrets, player and enemy alike, cannot target through pawns that have smoke between them and the turret.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Ranged Weapons</h1>
    <h4>Each die of damage is its own attack roll. (Ex: if it says 4d4, make four attack rolls each with 1d4 of damage)</h4>
    <!-- Weapon Accuracy: Is the weapon accuracy of the weapon at that range. If it is not one of the listed values at 3, 12, 25, or 40 tiles -->

Armor like this is used by imperial cataphracts to break heavily fortified positions in frontal assaults when no other option is available.</td>
