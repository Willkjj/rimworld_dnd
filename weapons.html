        <h1>Weapons</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>100 guns for 50 people</h3>
        <br>
        <p>You'll need to defend yourself while on the rim. And while mass production is rare, scavenged items are not. Most denizens of the rim use any weapon they can find, if they can't make their own. So, stock up. Grab a shotgun to go with your greatbow. Carry an EMP launcher with your warhammer. There's a niche for nearly every weapon, so feel free to use any of them.</p>
        <p>Due to the nature of the rim, there is a people at every stage of development at any given time. Each of them are very capable at using their culture's weapons to defend themselves, or to attack their neighbors. Much of those are listed below.</p>
        <h4>Note: If a weapon is listed here, it overwrites what is written in the Player's Handbook. Otherwise, feel free to use any weapon here or in the PHB as written.</h4>
        <br>
        <h2>Definitions:</h2>
        <p>Explosive: This weapon has an AOE attack, the range of which is defined after the property (ex. "Explosive:5ft" means the explosion radius is 5 ft in a sphere). All creatures within this range are targets of this attack. In addition, while you make an attack roll as usual, the target must make a dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the result of your attack roll. On a success, they take half damage.</p>
        <p>Single Shot: Though it has multiple damage die, it has one singular target and one attack roll.</p>
        <p>EMP: Its lightning damage is nondamaging, except creatues with electrical components will become stunned for 1-2 turns. 1 turn if the damgae is less than or equal to 10, 2 turns if higher.</p>
        <p>Blind Smoke: Reduces accuracy of any regular projectile, player or enemy, making the area lightly obscured and imposing disadvantage on attacks sent through the area. The smoke does not have to cover either the shooter or the target; any smoke in the way will cause the accuracy reduction. In addition, turrets, player and enemy alike, cannot target through pawns that have smoke between them and the turret.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Ranged Weapons</h1>
    <h4>Each die of damage is its own attack roll. (Ex: if it says 4d4, make four attack rolls each with 1d4 of damage)</h4>
    <!-- Weapon Accuracy: Is the weapon accuracy of the weapon at that range. If it is not one of the listed values at 3, 12, 25, or 40 tiles -->
