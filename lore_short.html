    <h2>Welcome to the Rim</h2>
    <br>
    <p>You probably don't remember how you got here. Or maybe you do. Either's fine. Maybe you and your people have been here for ages, or maybe you crashlanded here yesterday. That's fine too.</p>

    <p>Just know that life on the Rim here ain't kind.</p>

    <p>From bandits and raiders to disease and starvation, there's a lot here that can kill you if you don't keep your head. Some folks might be used to that, and they'll fit in well. But those empire softies from the glitterworlds and urbworlds on their high thrones of tech and gilt might not understand the truth of life here: it might just kill you.</p>

    <p>So that's why I've put together a little somethin' to maybe help folks who come along and find it. If you're one of those folks then congrats, you've got your first edge on the others.</p>

    <p>I'll be real honest with you, 'cause you'll never know what to expect otherwise. You can do everything right, and still fail. That's just how the gods play with us. Only thing folks like us can do is pick ourselves up, rummage through the ashes, and rebuild.</p>

    <p>On that note, there's no kind of folk like trustworthy folk. Typically, you can trust them by their reputation. Heard rumors their last visitors turned up on the slave market? Don't stay for the night. Heard they turned their last trading partner into soup? Don't stay for dinner.</p>

    <p>If you've heard rumors that one faction or another has been drugging their friends, harvesting their organs, and using them as enslaved fighters, the best thing you can do for you and your own is to believe it and move far away.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, if you find a people who have only a few blemishes on an otherwise spotless reputation, then go ahead. Settle down for a time. Desperation brings folks together, you'll find that one out sooner or later. Better with the folks that kill the least than out in the deserts with no one around but Cheatem and Shanker for company.</p>

    <p>Lastly, know your worth.</p> 

    <p>600 silver per organ, more specifically. You better pull your weight in gold and work to earn your keep if you want to be worth more than that. Most settle down and play house, but if you're the type, a lot of gold can be won just by winning bounties and fulfilling requests. Best way to ensure your survival is to make people want something from you that you can only give of your own free will. </p>

    <p>But what do I know? Sitting fat and rested in my bed after 50 years of livin' in this scorched hellhole. I'm sure you could get the same knowledge from any ol' corpse sticking out of a shallow grave.</p>

    <p>If you aren't so sure, then sit down and perk up. I've a few things more to say.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Rimworlds</h3> 
    <p>A Rimworld is defined as a planet on the edge of known space with little to no government, and technological advancement determined by throwin' darts at a board. This is where you are, so get comfy. Unless for some infernal reason the gods take pity on you and you find a ship or build one yourself, you'll join the ranks of millions who never leave their rock once they crash. Expect resistance, even if you only <i>think</i> you can get off. Folks with more guns than you will do everything they can to make sure its their own hide on that ship rather than yours. </p>

    <p>The most important thing to remember on the rim besides "everything can and will kill you" is that anything can and will happen. It's an infinite universe, and that infinite universe has dumped its waste on every rim out there. Each is different, but all are filled with an amalgam of every kind of people out there. Religion, culture, tech level, every thing you can think has their place. And every kind of threat, human or otherwise, but I've already given my two cents on that.</p>
    <br>
   <h3>Archotechs</h3>
   <p>Imagine the smartest computer you can think of. Then double it. Triple it. Times a million for every second you've been alive. That's an archotech. Once it starts getting smarter, it never stops. We don't know how many are out there. And I wouldn't mention them outside of a nightmare except for they're real and they're here and if they want you dead they can microwave your brain from a million miles away. Yet they don't and we go on. A fully-empowered archotech thinks on a level incomprehensible to humans, the same way a human thinks incomprehensibly to an ant. Once one is built, and given the ability to act on the physical world, they almost immediately become the de-facto ruler of their world.
   </p>

   <p>Usually they stop there. Turn their own world into their own playground, build technological wonders, and stop. Some like to send fleets of their mechanical monsters to us, either to break us down slowly or just poke fun at us. Either way, we deal with archotechs just as we deal with human threats: fight or be killed.</p>

   <p>Last thing on archotechs: their technology. Almost everything in this universe that we can't explain can be attributed to an archotech treating the physical world like its sandbox. From magic-like psycasts to monsters in the night. Unless you or a friend you know is a psycaster, usually coming across the work of an archotech is a bad bad thing.</p>
