   <h3>Rimworlds</h3> <p>Planets lacking in strong central government and low in population density. These places tend to hover around the industrial level of technology or lower. Because they’re not homogenized by a central government, they tend to see a lot of interaction between people of different technology levels, as travelers crashland or ancient communities stumble out of their cryptosleep vaults. These planets are often at the rim of known space, hence the name.</p>
    <br>
   <h3>Archotechs</h3>
   <p>The finish line of human technological development is at the development of archotechnology.</p>

<p>An archotech is a machine superintelligence. A fully-empowered archotech thinks on a level incomprehensible to humans, in the same way a human thinks incomprehensibly to an ant. Once such a machine is built, and empowered to act upon the physical world, it is so powerful as to become the automatic sovereign of its world. It can build new computing facilities underground or in space to enhance its own intelligence, build self-replicating mechanoids to engage in construction or production or war, and design and execute strategies that would be inconceivably intricate and difficult for any organization of humans. Some human groups worship archotechs.</p>

<p>Each archotech is different, and nearly all are distant and incomprehensible from a human’s point of view. They reside in occult computer networks hidden under planets, in space stations, hidden inside a glitterworld’s Internet, or instantiated as million-mile superstructures wrapped around stars.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the Rim</h2>
<p>You probably don't remember how you got here. Or maybe you do. Either's fine. Maybe you and your people have been here for ages, or maybe you crashlanded here yesterday. That's fine too.</p>

<p>Just know that life on the Rim here ain't kind.</p>

<p>From bandits and raiders to disease and starvation, there's a lot here that can kill you if you don't keep your head. Some folks might be used to that, and they'll fit in well. But those empire softies from the glitterworlds and urbworlds on their high thrones of tech and gilt might not understand the truth of life here: it might just kill you.</p>

<p>So that's why I've put together a little somethin' to maybe help folks who come along and find it. If you're one of those folks then congrats, you've got your first edge on the others.</p>

<p>I'll be real honest with you, 'cause you'll never know what to expect otherwise. You can do everything right, and still fail. That's just how the gods play with us. Only thing folks like us can do is pick ourselves up, rummage through the ashes, and rebuild.</p>

<p>On that note, there's no kind of folk like trustworthy folk. Typically, you can trust them by their reputation. Heard rumors their last visitors turned up on the slave market? Don't stay for the night. Heard they turned their last trading partner into soup? Don't stay for dinner.</p>

<p>If you've heard rumors that one faction or another has been drugging their friends, harvesting their organs, and using them as enslaved fighters, the best thing you can do for you and your own is to believe it and move far away.</p>

<p>Aside from that, if you find a people who have only a few blemishes on an otherwise spotless reputation, then go ahead. Settle down for a time. Desperation brings folks together, you'll find that one out sooner or later. Better with the folks that kill the least than out in the deserts with no one around but Cheatem and Shanker for company.</p>

<p>Lastly, know your worth.</p> 

<p>600 silver per organ, more specifically. You better pull your weight in gold and work to earn your keep if you want to be worth more than that. Most settle down and play house, but if you're the type, a lot of gold can be won just by winning bounties and fulfilling requests. Best way to ensure your survival is to make people want something from you that you can only give of your own free will. </p>

<p>But what do I know? Sitting fat and rested in my bed after 50 years of livin' in this scorched hellhole. I'm sure you could get the same knowledge from any ol' corpse sticking out of shallow grave.</p>

<p>If you aren't so sure, then sit down and perk up. I've a few things more to say.</p>
