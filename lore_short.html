    <h2>Welcome to the Rim</h2>
    <br>
    <p>You probably don't remember how you got here. Or maybe you do. Either's fine. Maybe you and your people have been here for ages, or maybe you crashlanded here yesterday. That's fine too.</p>

    <p>Just know that life on the Rim here ain't kind.</p>

    <p>From bandits and raiders to disease and starvation, there's a lot here that can kill you if you don't keep your head. Some folks might be used to that, and they'll fit in well. But those empire softies from the glitterworlds and urbworlds on their high thrones of tech and gilt might not understand the truth of life here: it might just kill you.</p>

    <p>So that's why I've put together a little somethin' to maybe help folks who come along and find it. If you're one of those folks then congrats, you've got your first edge on the others.</p>

    <p>I'll be real honest with you, 'cause you'll never know what to expect otherwise. You can do everything right, and still fail. That's just how the gods play with us. Only thing folks like us can do is pick ourselves up, rummage through the ashes, and rebuild.</p>

    <p>On that note, there's no kind of folk like trustworthy folk. Typically, you can trust them by their reputation. Heard rumors their last visitors turned up on the slave market? Don't stay for the night. Heard they turned their last trading partner into soup? Don't stay for dinner.</p>

    <p>If you've heard rumors that one faction or another has been drugging their friends, harvesting their organs, and using them as enslaved fighters, the best thing you can do for you and your own is to believe it and move far away.</p>

    <p>Aside from that, if you find a people who have only a few blemishes on an otherwise spotless reputation, then go ahead. Settle down for a time. Desperation brings folks together, you'll find that one out sooner or later. Better with the folks that kill the least than out in the deserts with no one around but Cheatem and Shanker for company.</p>

    <p>Lastly, know your worth.</p> 

    <p>1000 silver per organ, more specifically. You better pull your weight in gold and work to earn your keep if you want to be worth more than that. Most settle down and play house, but if you're the type, a lot of gold can be won just by winning bounties and fulfilling requests. Best way to ensure your survival is to make people want something from you that you can only give of your own free will. </p>

    <p>But what do I know? Sitting fat and rested in my bed after 50 years of livin' in this scorched hellhole. I'm sure you could get the same knowledge from any ol' corpse sticking out of a shallow grave.</p>

    <p>If you aren't so sure, then sit down and perk up. I've a few things more to say.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Rimworlds</h3> 
    <p>A Rimworld is defined as a planet on the edge of known space with little to no government, and technological advancement determined by throwin' darts at a board. This is where you are, so get comfy. Unless for some infernal reason the gods take pity on you and you find a ship or build one yourself, you'll join the ranks of millions who never leave their rock once they crash. Expect resistance, even if you only <i>think</i> you can get off. Folks with more guns than you will do everything they can to make sure its their own hide on that ship rather than yours. </p>

    <p>The most important thing to remember on the rim besides "everything can and will kill you" is that anything can and will happen. It's an infinite universe, and that infinite universe has dumped its waste on every rim out there. Each is different, but all are filled with an amalgam of every kind of people out there. Religion, culture, tech level, every thing you can think has their place. And every kind of threat, human or otherwise, but I've already given my two cents on that.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Archotechs</h3>
    <p>Imagine the smartest computer you can think of. Then double it. Triple it. Times a million for every second you've been alive. That's an archotech. Once it starts getting smarter, it never stops. We don't know how many are out there. And I wouldn't mention them outside of a nightmare except for they're real and they're here and if they want you dead they can microwave your brain from a million miles away. Yet they don't and we go on. A fully-empowered archotech thinks on a level incomprehensible to humans, the same way a human thinks incomprehensibly to an ant. Once one is built, and given the ability to act on the physical world, they almost immediately become the de-facto ruler of their world.
   </p>

    <p>Usually they stop there. Turn their own world into their own playground, build technological wonders, and stop. Some like to send fleets of their mechanical monsters to us, either to break us down slowly or just poke fun at us. Either way, we deal with archotechs just as we deal with human threats: fight or be killed.</p>

    <p>Last thing on archotechs: their technology. Almost everything in this universe that we can't explain can be attributed to an archotech treating the physical world like its sandbox. From magic-like psycasts to monsters in the night. Unless you or a friend you know is a psycaster, usually coming across the work of an archotech is a bad bad thing.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Psycasting</h3>
    <p>Psycasting is like magic, if you don't know much about it. No one really understands it, but folks with the capabilities can meditate, connecting themselves on some fundamental level to the powers of the archotechs. I guess they divvy psycast abilities into "levels" of training, starting at 1. Usually people don't go too far in the craft, 'cause you have to have access to highly unique "Psylink neuroformers". Rumor has it the empire has the ability to make 'em, but more likely they're just scavenging tech from the archotechs like we all wish we could. Either way, when you get one, you can use it to permanently deepen your connection to the archotechs, just once. After you use one, it disintigrates into ash. 'Course you can always steal another. The empire would have you think that the only way to get them is through becoming a royal and earning honor from them, but in reality there's all sorts of ways to learn more. I hear that you can also gain psycasting levels through meditating with nature, specifically the rare anima trees. Some say they're manifestations of the soul of the world, which humanity can communicate with. I don't know about that, all's I know is that they're weird and you <i>can</i> gain psylevels through them, in time.</p>
    <p>Once you use a psylink neuroformer, it gives you the knowledge of how to cast one single psycast, which can be anything from temporarily half blinding a group, to skipping yourself halfway accross the planet. There's a whole list somewhere out there, but I never got my hands on it. The other thing about psycasts is what they call "neural heat". Apparently your brain, just like any gun out there, can overheat with too much quiick use. Though I'm fairly certain it's more of a kind of psychich static, from what I hear. Either way, it can be extremely painful, to the point of sending a psycaster into a coma if they're not careful. Know your limits, and don't exceed them. Unless you're gonna die, 'cause that's worse.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Life on the Rim</h3>
    <p>Typically, life looks like people banding together and settling down. You'll likely see a lot of that out there. Happy people, tribal people, vicious raiding people, and the like. They get their people together and create a life worth living. Others, like me, wander around and visit from colony to colony. I had my moments, but for the most part I was out there in the plains and sands and forests, takin' rest when I could. As I said earlier, make sure when you rest it's with good, reliable people whose cookpots can't fit people.</p>
    <p> Oh and, time is generally measured in three month increments called quadums. People call 'em Aprimay, Jugust, Septober and Decembary, but I just call 'em Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. And while we're on the record keeping subjects, most people measure wealth in silver and gold, in that order, one unit of gold is worth 10 silver. Smallest bit you can get is 1 silver, but the way things work is that you get a hundred silver easily, and spend nine tenths of it just paying for medicine next time you see a trader.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Loot and the Like</h3>
    <p>Typically, the main motivator for leaving the safety of home and hearth is to hunt rare technology. There's stuff out there enough to turn any homebody's head. I can't even begin to go off on the kind of stuff out there, but it's usually either a weapon of fame and legend, or some kind of rare technology that no body can replicate anymore. Sometimes, it's worth raiding ancient ruins just for the hopes of finding some kind of bionic gear that you can't make yet. In general just ask the locals if they have any local rumors. In a world where great cities fall every other week or so, a lot of great marvels ends up downstream.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Drugs</h3>
    <p>With space age technology, comes space age ways of getting space age high. Recently, the big ones have been yayo, flake, smokeleaf, wakeup, go-juice and ambrosia. Yayo and flake come from the same plant, just are refined differently. Yayo tends to be considered the harder of the two. Both are mainly combat drugs in the more "refined" societies. Snort a fistful of yayo and you can tear through a mechanoid with your bare hands. Though, you can probably see psychite tea in tribal colonies. It's mildly euphoric, but its mostly used to "commune with the gods" or some mumbo jumbo like that. Smokeleaf is entirely a recreational drug, since it makes folks calm down and want to party. Symptoms include red eyes, tiredness, and a severe case of the munchies. Ambrosia is like a weaker version of that. It's really common amongst the royals who can afford to spend all day getting high. Wakeup is kinda like a caffeine pill mixed with painkiller. They're mostly just used in the coreworlds when academics need a particular edge on their peers, but out on the rim it can keep a fighter fighting a little longer than their enemies. Go-juice is the same, if a little more intense. Think of it as a mix of yayo and an energy drink, because that's exactly what it is. Just about the hardest energy drink you can find. Most soliders thrive on it, and some breeds of xenohumans literally can't live without it. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Gear and Quality</h3>
    <p>in general, if you want something good, you gotta make it yourself</p>
