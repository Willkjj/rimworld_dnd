   <p class="inline"><p class="bold_text">Rimworlds:</p> Planets lacking in strong central government and low in population density. These places tend to hover around the industrial level of technology or lower. Because theyâ€™re not homogenized by a central government, they tend to see a lot of interaction between people of different technology levels, as travelers crashland or ancient communities stumble out of their cryptosleep vaults. These planets are often at the rim of known space, hence the name.</p>
