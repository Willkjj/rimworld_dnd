        <h1>Hussars</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Designed as soldiers, hussars are great at combat and not much else. They are dependent on go-juice, but immune to any of its negative side effects.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Hussars are engineered soldiers. They fight aggressively and with precision, heal fast, thrive in extreme temperatures, and freely ingest military drugs. They have a genetic dependence on go-juice, which also makes them less likely to rebel against their commanders.</p>

        <p>While hussars' emotions make them dangerous in combat, they can't relate to baseliner humans. They are famous for their blood-red eyes and "hussar stare", a dead expression that unsettles many people. Their lack of expression and burning aggressive nature has led to many violent misunderstandings.</p>
        
        <p>In most societies where they live, hussars are kept separated from the rest of the population. Hussars are single-purpose tools - and they generally aren't bothered by the fact.</p>
