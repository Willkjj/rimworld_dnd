        <h1>Dirtmoles</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Dirtmoles are extremely capable at digging or mining tasks, but suffer from a sensitivity to light, and have poor eyesight at distance.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>With gray skin adapted to artificial light, they thrive in cramped and dark spaces where combat and travel happen over short distances. They are extremely capable at digging or mining tasks. In the open, however, they suffer from a sensitivity to light, slow speed and poor eyesight at distance.</p>

        <p>After the first tunnel colonies failed due to the stress of confinement, colonization agencies began genetically altering colonists to live without open space or sunlight. This xenotype is known colloquially as the dirtmoles. Today, dirtmoles have expanded out of their original tunnel homes and rule many confined spaces in the anthrosphere. They can be found in deep mines, cramped low-tech spacecraft, and teeming by the billions in the dark underlayers of countless urbworlds.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Dirtmole Traits</h2>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Constitution and Strength scores both increase by 2</p>
        <p><b>Alignment.</b> Most Dirtmoles are Good aligned, due to their ancient colonist backgrounds. They are used to helping out those of their own society.</p>
        <p><b>Speed.</b> In direct sunlight, your walking speed is 25. Otherwise, it is 30</p>
        <p><b>Darkvision.</b> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior darkvision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern between color in darkness, only in shades of gray</p>
        <p><b>CCQ Preference.</b> Your melee damage is increased by 150%. Round up each time. (3 * 150% = 4.5, rounded to 5.), but your ranges with ranged weapons are halved</p>
        <p><b>Fast Healer.</b> Rests take half as long to gain the full effect. Or, gain twice the health from resting</p>
