        <h1>Neanderthals</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Ancient humans that are slow to move and slow to learn, but are incredibly tanky.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Neanderthals are stocky, powerfully-built humanoids. Their most salient characteristic is that they are difficult to hurt: They are very resistant to injury, and their strong immune systems protect them from infection. However, without ever having evolved in a complex civilization, they are less adept than baseliner humans at intellectual and social tasks, and their impulsiveness can make them dangerously aggressive.</p>

        <p>Homo neanderthalensis was originally an archaic population of hominids that emerged over 200,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch. After they were replaced by and merged with humans 30,000 years ago, they were absent for tens of thousands of years until scientists resurrected them from ancient DNA. Neanderthals now survive in sub-societies on some settled planets. On the rimworlds, neanderthal tribes carve out the same existence as their Earth ancestors did so long ago.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Neanderthal Traits</h2>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Strength increases by 2, and your Constitution increases by 1.</p>
        <p><b>Alignment.</b> Neanderthals are good to them and those they trust, which just so happens to be anyone who shows them kindness in turn. Whether through simplemindedness or natural family values, they generally lean Good aligned. </p>
        <p><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 25 ft.</p>
        <p><b>Environmental Tolerance.</b> You are tolerant to both hot and cold climates.</p>
        <p><b>Xenohuman Tanks.</b> All incoming damage is halved, and your outgoing damage is increased by 150% Your melee damage is increased by 150%. Round up each time. (3 * 150% = 4.5, rounded to 5.). </p>
        <p><b>Simple Minded.</b> Due to an underdeveloped memory center, you gain XP at half the rate of others.</p>
