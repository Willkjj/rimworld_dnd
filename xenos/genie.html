        <h1>Genies</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Designed to be engineers, genies are calm and great at crafting and intellect, but are fragile and otherwise socially inept.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Designed to be engineers, genies' delicate bones and natural aptitude with machines allow them to manipulate devices with remarkable precision. They are emotionally cold and can follow orders where others might panic. However, they are fragile, and their amplified nerve impulses make them easy to debilitate with relatively little pain. With so much of their brains dedicated to analyzing machines, they lack the neural hardware to analyze emotions, so they sometimes come off as socially inept. Their dead calm makes it even harder for them to relate to what they see as madly-hotheaded baseliner humans.</p>

        <p>Genies were engineered thousands of years ago by a long-disbanded space navy to hold engineering positions on large starships. Today, genies still serve as engineers in great cities and fleets, but many can also be found working as lawyers, pilots, and musicians.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Genie Traits</h2>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Intelligence and Wisdom scores both increase by 2, and your Charisma decreases by 1.</p>
        <p><b>Alignment.</b> Most Genies are lawful, firmly believing in a the benefits of a well ordered society where orders are calmly given and calmly followed. </p>
        <p><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30.</p>
        <p><b>Poor Handler.</b> Disadvantage on all animal handling checks, but you gain proficiency in History and Investigation, as well as Arcana</p>
        <p><b>Mythical Artesians.</b> Genies are famed across the universe as engineers that can make you anything you wish for. You add +2 to any ability check made with artesian's tools. You also gain proficiency with one set of artesian's tools of your choice. </p>
        <p><b>Quite Delicate.</b> Genies are more fragile than other xenohumans on the rim. You take 15% more damage. Round up each time (10 * 115% = 11.5 rounded to 12).</p>
