        <h1>Highmates</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Designed to be perfect mates, highmates can psychically bond with whoever they first romance, for strong buffs. Happy, but incapable of violence.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Designed companions and concubines with a unique ability to psychically bond with a mate, highmates are empathic, beautiful, cheerful, and talented in social matters. They are also inept at manual tasks, physically weak, and mentally incapable of violence.</p>

        <p>On a few wealthy worlds, highmate xenogerms are commercially available and some people become highmates as a sort of career. However, many societies find them abhorrent, either because they distract people from forming natural families, or because they are humans shaped to serve the pleasures of another. On such worlds they are either reserved as playthings of the powerful, or banned entirely. This particular line of highmate fits the fashions of classical Novaroma, but many other variants exist.</p>
