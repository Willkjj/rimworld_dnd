        <h1>Impids</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Fast runners that can spew fire, impids are depressive and struggle with farming and melee combat.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Made for desert life, impid cultures live on many rimworlds and dry deathworlds. Impids are extremely fast-moving, easily tolerate high temperatures, and can spew fire from their mouths. Though they are masters on the sand, impids struggle in other environments. They are terrible with farming. They fight well at range, but in close combat their physical weakness becomes apparent.</p>

        <p>Outlanders call them dustrunners because of their speed over open terrain and resistance to heat. Some tribes call them devils because of their horns and because they burn their enemies. Impid tribes' combat tactics usually center on rapid-approach incendiary attacks using both handheld fire weapons and their fire spew ability.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Impid Traits</h2>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Dexterity increases by 2 and your Wisdom increases by 1.</p>
        <p><b>Alignment.</b> Most Impids are chaotic neutral, genetically predisposed to do whatever necessary to survie out in the desert wastes.  </p>
        <p><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 40.</p>
        <p><b>Heat Tolerance.</b> In addition to being highly tolerant to hot climates, you also have resistance to fire damage. However, you gain levels of exhaustion quicker in colder climates.</p>
        <p><b>Fire Breathers.</b> You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. It deals damage in a 15 foot line. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the area must make a dexterity saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increase to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th, and 5d6 at 16th level. After using your breath weapon, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
        <p><b>Slow Healing.</b> You heal slower than others. Resting takes half as long to get the full rest. Or, after a day of normal resting, you gain half the normal hitpoints</p>
