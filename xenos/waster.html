        <h1>Wasters</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Bioweapons that can thrive in toxic buildup, survive disease, and can ingest wake-up freely, but have a need for some form of psychite.	</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Wasters are aggressive, immune to toxic pollution, almost impervious to disease, and can ingest as much psychite and wake-up drugs as they wish with no ill effects. Their toxin-adapted metabolism means they must consume some form of psychite - usually flake or yayo.</p>

        <p>Originally engineered to prevent resettlement of post-apocalyptic deathworlds, wasters are living area-denial weapons. Waster pirates armed with toxic weapons are the bane of many frontier peoples, both on the rimworlds and in the depths of the urbworld hyperstructures.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Waster Traits</h2>
        <p><b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Constitution increases by 2, but your charisma decreases by 1.</p>
        <p><b>Alignment.</b> Most Wasters thrive on conflict in their aggressive and predominantly evil-disposed society. One can consider it a toxic environment. </p>
        <p><b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30.</p>
        <p><b>Impervious.</b> You are completely immune to airborn toxins, as well as addiction to the wake-up drug.</p>
        <p><b>Poison Stimulus.</b>Each second, you will increase in stimulus severity by +3.33% if on polluted terrain, or −0.3% if on unpolluted terrain. If your stimulus level is ≥0%: You gain ×110% Move Speed. if it is ≥20%: gain ×115% Move Speed, +1 to attacks and damage. If it is ≥50%: gain ×120% Move Speed, +2 to attacks and damage.</p>
        <p><b>Addicted From Birth.</b> You are genetically addicted to the psychite (from any source), and must regularly take it in order to survive. From the age of 13, if you abstain from psychite, after 5 days you will begin to feel withdrawl effects. After 30 days, you will fall into a coma, and after 60 days, you die. Additionally, when craving psychite, your base walking speed is decreased to 25,, and you suffer disadvantage on ability checks based on manipulation, and disadvantage on attack rolls.</p>
